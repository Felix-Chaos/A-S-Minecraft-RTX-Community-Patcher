## What is Actions & Stuff: Enhanced for RTX?

**Actions & Stuff Patcher for BetterRTX** is a Patcher for the original *Actions & Stuff* resource pack designed to:

- Enable RTX for A&S 
  - by Patching the Modified and your version Together
- Enable RTX for Serves

Because this is a modification of an existing pack, the `.mcpack` is **NOT distributed directly**. Instead, this project provides a **patcher tool** that:

- Builds the Patched version from your official version installed from the Minecraft Marketplace or from a provided `.zip` or `.mcpack` file.
