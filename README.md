## ⚠️ Important Community Notice

This is a **community project** based on the original *Actions & Stuff* resource pack by Oreville Studios.  
**This patcher is currently an early-stage tool** — it has NOT been fully tested or polished for end users yet.  
We have uploaded the original creator’s files to support community development and plan to enable support for **A&S 1.6** soon.
You can find Stable versions at the Releases Tab.

## What is Actions & Stuff: Enhanced for RTX?

**Actions & Stuff: Enhanced for RTX** is a modified version of the original *Actions & Stuff* resource pack designed to:

- Fix visual issues with 3D items and animations  
- Add dynamic lights for select items  
- Improve the RTX experience in Minecraft Bedrock Edition

Because this is a modification of an existing pack, the `.mcpack` is **NOT distributed directly**. Instead, this project provides a **patcher tool** that:

- Builds the enhanced version from your official version installed from the Minecraft Marketplace or from a provided `.zip` or `.mcpack` file.

---

## Requirements

- [BetterRTX](https://bedrock.graphics/) (must be installed)
- A copy of **Actions & Stuff** from the Minecraft Marketplace or `.zip`/`.mcpack` file

---

## How to Use

1. Extract and run `AnSRTXPatcher.exe`.  
2. Choose to either patch from the Marketplace version or patch a `.zip`/`.mcpack` file.  
3. Wait for the compression process to finish, then click the **Patch** button.  
4. Your patched pack will be saved as **`Actions & Stuff Enhanced RTX.mcpack`** next to the `.exe`.  
5. Install and enable **only** the patched pack in Minecraft, placing it at the very top of your resource pack list.  
6. Close the patcher and confirm the `.exe` process is no longer running in the background.
