# Actions & Stuff: Enhanced for RTX (Community Patcher)

---

## ⚠️ Important Community Notice

This is a **community project** based on the original *Actions & Stuff* resource pack by Oreville Studios.  
**This patcher is currently an early-stage tool** — it has NOT been fully tested or polished for end users yet.  
We have uploaded the original creator’s files to support community development and plan to enable support for **A&S 1.6** soon.
You can find Stable versions at the Releases Tab.

## What is Actions & Stuff: Enhanced for RTX?

**Actions & Stuff: Enhanced for RTX** is a modified version of the original *Actions & Stuff* resource pack designed to:

- Fix visual issues with 3D items and animations  
- Add dynamic lights for select items  
- Improve the RTX experience in Minecraft Bedrock Edition

Because this is a modification of an existing pack, the `.mcpack` is **NOT distributed directly**. Instead, this project provides a **patcher tool** that:

- Builds the enhanced version from your official version installed from the Minecraft Marketplace or from a provided `.zip` or `.mcpack` file.
